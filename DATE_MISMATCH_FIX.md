# Date Mismatch Fix: Calendar vs Booking Summary

## Issue Confirmed
From the screenshot, I can see:
- **Calendar shows**: Dates 29, 30, 31 selected (Oct 29-31 stay)
- **Booking Summary shows**: "28 Oct" and "29 Oct" (wrong dates)

This is the timezone issue where dates are being parsed as UTC and shifted backward.

## Root Cause
The `parseLocalDate` fix I implemented is in the code, but the dev server needs to be restarted to pick up the new `lib/date-utils.ts` module.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Date Utils (`lib/date-utils.ts`)
```typescript
export const parseLocalDate = (dateString: string): Date => {
  const [year, month, day] = dateString.split('-').map(Number);
  return new Date(year, month - 1, day);
};
```

### 2. Updated Booking Page
Changed from:
```typescript
new Date(night.date).toLocaleDateString(...)  // ❌ Wrong - UTC parsing
```

To:
```typescript
parseLocalDate(night.date).toLocaleDateString(...)  // ✅ Correct - Local parsing
```

### 3. API Verification
The API is returning correct dates:
```
Oct 29, 2025: R2,400
Oct 30, 2025: R2,392
```

## What You Need to Do

**Restart your dev server** to pick up the fix:

1. **Stop the current dev server**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running

2. **Start it again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Refresh your browser** and test the booking page

## Expected Result After Restart

**Calendar**: Shows Oct 29-31 selected  
**Booking Summary**: Should now show:
```
2 nights                          R4,792
├─ Oct 29                         R2,400
└─ Oct 30                         R2,392

Cleaning fee                      R500
Service fee (12%)                 R575

────────────────────────────────────
Total                             R5,867
```

## Why This Happened

When JavaScript parses `"2025-10-29"` with `new Date()`, it treats it as UTC midnight. In South Africa (UTC+2), this becomes `2025-10-28 22:00:00`, which displays as "28 Oct" when formatted.

The fix creates dates in the local timezone instead, so `"2025-10-29"` stays as October 29th.

## Files Changed

1. **`lib/date-utils.ts`** (NEW) - Timezone-safe date parsing
2. **`app/accommodations/[id]/book/page.tsx`** - Uses the new date parsing

## Verification

After restarting, the dates in the booking summary should match the calendar selection exactly. The fix is already in the code - it just needs the dev server to reload the new module.
